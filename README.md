# bank-note-authentication-using-logical-regression
This project demonstrates how to use logistic regression for banknote authentication using a dataset. The example covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. First, data loading and exploration involves reading the dataset and displaying the distribution of the target variable using a count plot. During data preprocessing, the dataset is balanced by removing excess entries from the majority class and then split into training and testing sets. Feature scaling is applied to standardize the features to have zero mean and unit variance. The next step is model training, where a logistic regression model is trained on the processed data. Model evaluation follows, using a confusion matrix to evaluate performance and calculate accuracy. Finally, the model makes predictions, determining the class and probability for a new banknote sample. This comprehensive process ensures accurate and reliable banknote authentication.
