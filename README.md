# bank-note-authentication-using-logical-regression
This project demonstrates logistic regression for banknote authentication. It covers data loading, preprocessing (balancing and splitting), feature scaling, model training, and evaluation using a confusion matrix. Finally, it predicts the class and probability for a new banknote sample, ensuring accurate authentication.
